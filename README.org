* XiamiDownloader
** Overview
This python script can download music from http://www.xiami.com
** Usage
   Open a terminal and type:
   :python XiamiDownloader.py [keyword]

   It will search http://www.xiami.com using the *keyword* and present the
   results in the terminal. You can type a number to choose a song to download
   or type "q" to quit.
** Reference
   This [[http://seorss.net/get-xiami-music.html][article]] explains how to obtain the real url for a song using the unique
   song id. I modify the original implementation and make it more easy to
   understand and more compact. In fact, the decoding process is just like
   'transposing a matrix'. See my implementation to get more details^_^.
